## Prompt:

>Think about how the various authors in the readings so far make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced. Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant ‘reads’ or ‘views’ of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not. What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? How much (or what) a priori knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

>Or, think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various digital history sites and projects you have explored so far. Tie what you find/observe to your own work. With regard to your own work on the tutorials, reflect on your design choices and the story you’re trying to tell, or the interesting thing you’ve found. Critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?
