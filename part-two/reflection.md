## Prompt:

> The tutorials for part two of the course revolve around ways of getting data from the web and onto our own personal machines. Here are some prompts to think about in the context of that work, and the readings listed above.

> Who pays for work to end up online? Who does the work? What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton does make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine?

> What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date.

### tips

- directly cite academic readings, technical blog posts, magazine articles, or other resources that have had an impact on your thinking.
- disucss and link to any annotations made using Hypothes.is that strike you as important; remember that each annotation has its own unique permalink. Make sure when you do make annotations that you are part of our class reading group.
