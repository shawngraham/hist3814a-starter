# hist3814a-starter
a starter repo for class work

- place your weekly work into the appropriate folder
- use the included files as templates for documenting your work
- if you decide to do the optional exit ticket, place it in the part four folder

- at the end of each part of the course, give me the link to your repository subfolder. The act of submitting the link tells me, "I'm ready for you to look at my materials."

- make new repos when you need to (if a given tutorial requires it, for instance)
- **make a new repo for the DH Exploration Exercise**
