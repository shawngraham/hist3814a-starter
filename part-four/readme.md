# readme

For the 4th part of the class, 'Communicating', make a new repo altogether and call it 'DH-Exploration-Exercise'. Put the results of this exercise (any digital ephemera you might create) into that repo. Have a log file for the nuts-and-bolts work; in a separate file communicate the results in an appropriate format.

# optional exit ticket

You can lodge anything you create for the optional exit ticket into this folder.
