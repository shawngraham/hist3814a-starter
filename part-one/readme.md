# readme file

Use the [reflection.md](reflection.md) document and the [log.md](log.md) document to organize your thoughts. Drop any screenshots or other ephemera you create for this part of the course into this folder. Embed images into your reflection or log if and when appropriate.

Click on a file name, and then the pencil icon, to make changes or updates. Remember to always hit the green commit button at the bottom of the page when you are done. This is not like Google Docs; nothing auto-saves.
